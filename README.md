# Python Raytracer
A physically-based ray tracer written in Python, implementing basic features:
- support for lambertian, metallic (specular/non-specular), dielectric material types
- anti-aliasing, defocus blure, dynamic FOV, free-moving camera
- BVH structures for logarithmic ray-object collision detection
